# Todoist MCP Server Extended

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@Chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended)](https://smithery.ai/server/@Chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that integrates Claude - or any MCP compatible LLM if you're crafty - with Todoist, enabling natural language task management via MCP tools. The tools in this server allows Claude to interact with your Todoist tasks, projects, sections, and labels using everyday language, while also optimized for LLM workflow efficiency.

## Quick Installation Guide

**Assuming you already have npm installed.**

A more comprehensive installation guide can be found in the [How-to Guide.](doc/Howto%20-%20Setting%20up%20Claude%20Todoist%20MCP%20on%20Windows.md)

### Installing via Smithery

To install Todoist MCP Server Extended for Claude Desktop via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@Chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended):

1. Run following command in cmd\pwsh:

```bash
    npx -y @smithery/cli install @Chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended --client claude
```

*Also compatible with cline or windsurf, by changing last parameter to  `--client cline` or `--client windsurf`*

### Installing via npm

1. Run following command in cmd\pwsh:

``` bash
    npm install -g @chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended
```

## Setup

### Grab a Todoist API Token

1. Log in to your [Todoist account](https://www.todoist.com/)
2. Navigate to `Settings â†’ Integrations`
3. Find your API token under `Developer`
4. Press `Copy API Token`

For more information about the Todoist API, visit the [official Todoist API documentation](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#developing-with-todoist).

### Add MCP Server and API Token Claude Desktop Client

1. In your  `claude_desktop_config.json` file, paste the following json snippet between: `"mcpServers":{ }:`

    ``` json
    "todoist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended"],
      "env": {
          "TODOIST_API_TOKEN": "PASTE-YOUR-API-TOKEN-HERE"
      }
    }
    ```

2. When all put together, it should look something like this:

    ``` json
    {
    "mcpServers": {
        "todoist": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@chrusic/todoist-mcp-server-extended"],
        "env": {
            "TODOIST_API_TOKEN": "PASTE-YOUR-API-TOKEN-HERE"
        }
        }
    }
    }
    ```

3. Claude Desktop client will then start the MCP server and load the tools on the next client (re)start.

## Docker Usage

If you're running this server in Docker (e.g., on Synology), make sure to pass the API token as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -e TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here your-image-name
```

Or using docker-compose:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  todoist-mcp:
    image: your-image-name
    environment:
      - TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

**Important**: Never put your API token in the Dockerfile or commit it to git. Always use environment variables or secrets management.

## Example Usage

Some simple suggestions on what to ask Claude. Note that sometimes you have to be *very* direct to get claude to use the tools:

* "Using the MCP tool: todoist_get_tasks, list all my tasks for the day."
* "Create task 'Review PR' in project 'Work' section 'To Do'"
* "Add label 'Important' to task 'Review PR'"
* "Show all tasks with label 'Important' in project 'Work'"
* "Move task 'Documentation' to section 'In Progress'"
* "Mark the documentation task as complete"
* "Give me some suggestions for listed tasks I can do today as I'm going shopping in town."
* "Break task X down in to smaller subtasks and add due dates, x, y, z."
